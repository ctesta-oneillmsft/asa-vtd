## Requirements

1. An Azure Account with the ability to create an Azure Synapse Workspace

2. Make sure the following resource providers are registered for your Azure Subscription.  

   - Microsoft.Sql
   - Microsoft.Synapse
   - Microsoft.StreamAnalytics
   - Microsoft.EventHub  

    See [further documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types#azure-portal) for more information on registering resource providers on the Azure Portal.

3. A Power BI Pro or Premium account to host Power BI reports, dashboards, and configuration of streaming datasets.

## Environment setup instructions

> **Note:**
>
> The entire setup process will take from 1.5 to 2 hours to complete.

## Azure Setup

### Task 1: Create a Power BI workspace

> Since Power BI workspaces must be unique within your tenant, you must first create the new workspace so you can **use the same name** when you create your Azure resource group in the next task.

1. Sign in into the [Power BI Portal](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) using your Azure credentials.

2. Select **Workspaces** in the left-hand menu **(1)**, then select **Create a workspace (2)**.

    ![The Workspaces menu item and Create a workspace button are highlighted.](media/pbi-create-workspace-link.png "Create a workspace")

3. In the form, enter **`synapse-in-a-day-demos`** (no spaces or special characters) into the **Workspace name** field (append a unique value to the name if the workspace name is already in use), then select **Save**. **Copy the workspace name** and save it in Notepad or similar for later reference.

    ![The form is configured as described.](media/pbi-create-workspace.png "Create a workspace")

### Task 2: Create a resource group in Azure

1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) using your Azure credentials.

2. On the Azure Portal home screen, select the **Menu** button on the top-left corner **(1)**. Hover over **Resource groups (2)**, then select **+ Create (3)**.

    ![The Create button is highlighted.](media/new-resourcegroup.png "Create resource group")

3. On the **Create a resource group** screen, select your desired Subscription and Region. For Resource group, enter **the same name as your Power BI workspace name** (such as `synapse-in-a-day-demos`), then select the **Review + Create** button.

    ![The Create a resource group form is displayed populated with Synapse-MCW as the resource group name.](media/bhol_resourcegroupform.png)

4. Select the **Create** button once validation has passed.

> **Important**: Take note of the _exact_ resource group name you provided for the steps that follow.

### Task 3: Create an Azure VM for the deployment scripts

We highly recommend executing the PowerShell scripts on an Azure Virtual Machine instead of from your local machine. Doing so eliminates issues due to pre-existing dependencies and more importantly, network/bandwidth-related issues while executing the scripts.

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), type in "virtual machines" in the top search menu and then select **Virtual machines** from the results.

    ![In the Services search result list, Virtual machines is selected.](media/azure-create-vm-search.png "Virtual machines")

2. Select **+ Add** on the Virtual machines page and then select the **Virtual machine** option.

3. In the **Basics** tab, complete the following:

   | Field                          | Value                                              |

### Task 4: Create Azure Synapse Analytics workspace

1. Deploy the workspace through the following Azure ARM template (press the button below):

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fctesta-oneillmsft%2Fasa-vtd%2Fmaster%2Fartifacts%2Fenvironment-setup%2fautomation%2F00-asa-workspace-core.json" target="_blank"><img src="https://aka.ms/deploytoazurebutton" /></a>

2. On the **Custom deployment** form fill in the fields described below.

   - **Subscription**: Select your desired subscription for the deployment.
   - **Resource group**: Select the resource group you previously created.
   - **Region**: The region where your Azure Synapse environment will be created.

        > **Important**: The `Region` field under 'Parameters' will list the Azure regions where Azure Synapse Analytics is available as of November 2020. This will help you find a region where the service is available without being limited to where the resource group is defined.

   - **Unique Suffix**: This unique suffix will be used naming resources that will created as part of your deployment. Make sure you follow correct Azure [Resource naming](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/azure-best-practices/naming-and-tagging#resource-naming) conventions.
   - **SQL Administrator Login Password**: Provide a strong password for the SQLPool that will be created as part of your deployment. [Visit here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/password-policy?view=sql-server-ver15#password-complexity) to read about password rules in place. Your password will be needed during the next steps. Make sure you have your password noted and secured.

3. Select the **Review + create** button, then **Create**. The provisioning of your deployment resources will take approximately 13 minutes. **Wait** until provisioning successfully completes before continuing. You will need the resources in place before running the scripts below.

    ```powershell
    cd c:\labfiles\synapse-in-a-day-deployment\artifacts\environment-setup\automation\
    ```

* Execute `Connect-AzAccount` and sign in to your Microsoft user account when prompted.

    > [!WARNING]: You may receive the message "TenantId 'xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx' contains more than one active subscription. The first one will be selected for further use. You can ignore this at this point. When you execute the environment setup, you will choose the subscription in which you deployed the environment resources.

* Execute `az login` and sign in to your Microsoft user account when prompted.

    > If you receive the following error, and have already closed and re-opened the PowerShell window, you need to restart your computer and restart the steps in this task: `The term 'az' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or operable program`.

* Execute `.\01-environment-setup.ps1`

1. You will be prompted to setup your Azure PowerShell and Azure CLI context.

2. If you have more than one Azure Subscription, you will be prompted to enter the name of your desired Azure Subscription. You can copy and paste the value from the list to select one. For example:

    ![A subscription is copied and pasted into the text entry.](media/select-desired-subscription.png "Select desired subscription")

3. Enter the name of the resource group you created at the beginning of the environment setup (such as `synapse-in-a-day-demos`). This will make sure automation runs against the correct environment you provisioned in Azure.

    During the execution of the automation script you may be prompted to approve installations from PS-Gallery. Please approve to proceed with the automation.

    ![The Azure Cloud Shell window is displayed with a sample of the output from the preceding command.](media/untrusted-repo.png)

    > **NOTE** This script will take between 90 and 150 minutes to complete.

#### Potential errors that you can ignore

You may encounter a few errors and warnings during the script execution. The errors below can safely be ignored:

1. The following error may occur when creating SQL users and adding role assignments in the dedicated SQL pool, and can safely be ignored: `Principal 'xxx@xxx.com' could not be created. Only connections established with Active Directory accounts can create other Active Directory users.`

    ![Error is displayed.](media/error-cannot-create-principal.png "Cannot create principal")

2. Errors when creating the Synapse notebooks (*.ipynb files) that state `Unsupported operation: CreateOrUpdateNotebookResource` can safely be ignored.

    ![Errors are displayed.](media/error-notebook-create.png "Notebook creation errors")

3. Toward the end of the script, you may see the following error. If you do, it can be safely ignored:

<!-- ## Optional Features

### 30 Billion Rows Dataset

The WWI environment can be populated with 30 billion records to demonstrated large data scenarios. Due to the limits of Azure Cloud Shell's 20-minute runtime, the automation has to run on a stand-alone machine against your subscription to be able to go through the 4-5 hours long data loading process. If you decide to go with the 30 billion records option, use a local Powershell instance with admin privileges instead of Azure Cloud Shell.

1. [Install Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to your computer.

2. Navigate to a folder location you prefer on your computer and execute the command below to download automation scripts and artifacts.


    ```PowerShell
    git clone https://github.com/microsoft/Azure-Analytics-and-AI-Engagement.git synapse-wwi
    ```
    
    ![The Azure Cloud Shell window is displayed with the choices of different data sizes that can be loaded into the environment by the script.](media/local-git-clone.png)

3. Execute the following command to authenticate your powershell session with your Azure Subscription:
